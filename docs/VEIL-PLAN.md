# Veil Cluster: Plan and Progress

This document tracks rollout of the headless Kubernetes cluster "veil"
(`meteor-1..3`) and minimal refactors. Focus is on outstanding work and
validation.

## Status

- k3s HA control plane across `meteor-1..3` is healthy (3-member etcd)
- FluxCD bootstrapped in `flux-system`
- Core services installed via Flux:
  - MetalLB (L2, pool 192.168.0.220â€“239)
  - ingress-nginx (LoadBalancer)
  - kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana)
- API readyz and etcd health verified
- MetalLB LoadBalancer assignment validated (`lb-test` at 192.168.0.222)
- LAN DNS moved to `skaia` (Unbound). DHCP updated to point clients at
  `192.168.0.160`. Zone `veil.home.arpa` is served with records including:
  `ingress.veil.home.arpa`, `grafana.veil.home.arpa`
- DNS filtering enabled on `skaia` via Unbound RPZ (StevenBlack list)
- `skaia` remains on NetworkManager (no migration to systemd-networkd)
- Observability validated: Grafana reachable via `grafana.veil.home.arpa`
- Monitoring: Ingress hosts configured; default rules enabled. etcd metrics are
  scraped from control-plane nodes and the etcd dashboard is available and
  populated. kube-proxy, controller-manager, and scheduler metrics are scraped
  from nodes; corresponding alerts are clear.

## Outstanding work

- Admin kubeconfig for `dlk` with `veil` context

## Post-setup (later)

- [ ] Admin kubeconfig for `dlk` with `veil` context

System-managed kubeconfigs are written under `/etc/kubernetes/` on targets
(e.g., `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig` on meteors and `/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig-skaia`
on `skaia`). Zsh shells export `KUBECONFIG` to include these; switch contexts via:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context veil
```

Alternatively, copy a managed kubeconfig locally:

```bash
scp meteor-1:/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config-veil
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config-veil config rename-context veil veil
```

- [ ] Baseline Grafana dashboards and alerting rules
  - Import common Kubernetes dashboards

- [ ] Runbooks (backups, upgrades)
  - On-demand etcd snapshot:

    ```bash
    sudo k3s etcd-snapshot save --name on-demand-$(date +%F)
    ```

  - Rolling upgrades:

    ```bash
    kubectl drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
    # Rebuild host (NixOS), reboot, verify node Ready again
    kubectl uncordon <node>
    ```
