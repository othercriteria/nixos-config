# Cold Start Considerations

<rule>
name: cold_start

# Description
Document all manual steps required to bring up a new system from scratch that are not handled by NixOS or automation. Examples include creating ZFS datasets, provisioning hardware-specific firmware, or initial secret generation.

# Requirements
- All such steps must be:
  1. Clearly annotated in-line in the relevant config or code (with a comment like: # COLD START: ...)
  2. Summarized in `docs/COLD-START.md` with detailed, step-by-step instructions suitable for late-night troubleshooting
  3. Avoided where possible, but documented if unavoidable
- The documentation must be explicit, actionable, and assume no prior context
- Update the summary doc and in-line comments whenever a new cold start step is introduced or removed

# Examples
- Creating a ZFS dataset for Prometheus:
  - In config: `# COLD START: Requires /zfs/prometheus dataset to exist`
  - In docs/COLD-START.md: Step-by-step ZFS creation instructions
- Installing firmware for a specific device
- Generating initial secrets or tokens

# Enforcement
- PRs introducing new cold start steps must include both in-line annotation and doc update
- Reviewers should reject changes that add undocumented cold start steps

# Metadata
