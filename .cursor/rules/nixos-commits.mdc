description: Defines criteria and behavior for NixOS configuration commits
filters:
  - type: intent
    pattern: "code_change_complete"
  - type: content
    pattern: "(?i)\\b(commit|save|checkpoint|approved|lgtm|looks good)\\b"
  - type: content
    pattern: "(?i)\\b(skip|disable|bypass|no|ignore)[-_]?(pre[-_]?commit|hooks?)\\b"

    conditions:
      - pattern: "(?i)\\b(skip|disable|bypass|no|ignore)[-_]?(pre[-_]?commit|hooks?)\\b"
        message: |
          Disabling pre-commit hooks is not allowed. Fix reported issues or ask for guidance.

criteria:
  required:
    - Pre-commit checks pass
    - Documentation updated if needed
    - STRUCTURE.md up-to-date with structural changes
    - All .mdc files tracked in git
    - No debug code remains
    - Consistency maintained between pre-commit hooks and commit rules
    - All linting issues resolved
    - User verification of changes (see verification_rules)

verification_rules:
  - The user, not the Agent, must verify that changes are functional and don't break the system
  - Agents should NOT commit changes if there's any uncertainty about their impact
  - If unsure about changes, Agents must ask for user verification before committing
  - Agents should describe risks and potential impact for users to evaluate before committing
  - For significant system changes, Agents should suggest testing before committing

commit_message_format: |
  {type}: {concise description}

  {detailed description if needed}

  Breaking Changes:
  {breaking changes if any}

  Affected Hosts: {affected hosts}

types:
  - feat: New feature or functionality
  - fix: Bug fix or issue resolution
  - refactor: System reorganization without functional changes

  - input: "Agent is uncertain if a change will affect system stability"
    output: |
      "I've made the requested changes, but I'm uncertain if this will affect system stability.
      Before committing, can you verify these changes won't cause issues?
      Specifically, I'm concerned about:
      - The changes to network configuration
      - How this might affect the existing VPN setup

      Would you like to test these changes first, or should I make any adjustments before committing?"
