      Markdown files should follow these standards:

      1. Line length: Maximum 80 characters per line (except code blocks and tables)
      2. Ordered lists: Always start with 1 and increment by 1
      3. List spacing: Always have a blank line before and after lists
      4. Header spacing: Always have a blank line before and after headers
      5. Code blocks: Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
      6. Unordered lists: Use "-" for bullets with 2-space indentation for nested items
      7. Headers: Use ATX-style headers (# H1, ## H2) with a space after the # symbol
      8. Header nesting: Don't skip levels (e.g., don't go from ## to ####)

criteria:
  required:
    - Line length doesn't exceed 80 characters (except code blocks and tables)
    - Ordered lists start with 1 and increment by 1
    - Lists have blank lines before and after
    - Headers have blank lines before and after
    - Code blocks specify a language
    - Unordered lists use "-" for bullets
    - Headers follow ATX-style with space after #
    - Headers don't skip levels (e.g., ## to ####)

examples:
  - input: |
      This is a very long line that exceeds the 80 character limit and would cause the linter to fail.
    output: |
      This is a very long line that exceeds the 80 character limit and would
      cause the linter to fail.

  - input: |
      # Header
      Some text
      ## Subheader
    output: |
      # Header

      Some text

      ## Subheader

  - input: |
      # Header

      Some text
      - List item 1
      - List item 2
      More text
    output: |
      # Header

      Some text

      - List item 1
      - List item 2

      More text

  - input: |
      1. First item
      3. Third item
      4. Fourth item
    output: |
      1. First item
      2. Second item
      3. Third item

  - input: |
      ```
      const x = 1;
      ```
    output: |
      ```javascript
      const x = 1;
      ```

  - input: |
      # Main heading

      ### Subheading (skipping h2)
    output: |
      # Main heading

      ## Subheading level 2

      ### Subheading level 3
